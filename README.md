Here you can find my small projects on C++

# calculator
Just a simple calculator. My first graphical app.

I made this more for testing than for everyday use. I need to do some practice after all :^

Well, this is a calculator that can do all basic math operations like:
- addition
- subtraction
- multiplication
- division
- calculating percents
# guess a capital
Game where you should guess a capital of given country.

In game there is 3 difficulty levels:
- Easy
- Medium
- Hard

Of course, set of countries and number of difficulty levels are quite sparse right now.

And either you'll have to make do with what you have, or I'll get insipred someday and add something new.

^-^
